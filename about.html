<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m D Prince Piriyan—a Computer Science Engineering student, lifelong learner, and someone driven by the idea of turning potential into purpose. I'm currently navigating my second year of engineering in India, but my vision stretches far beyond borders—I aim to build a meaningful, high-performance life and settle in Europe (especially Finland) within the next decade.</p>

<p>My passions span across tech, creativity, and personal growth. Whether it’s coding in Java, Python, C++, or HTML, or diving deep into front-end development, I love the process of building things that matter. But I’m not just about the keyboard—I also train in calisthenics and boxing, push myself mentally through meditation and prayer, and stay creatively charged with video editing, art, and YouTube content creation.</p>

<p>My channel is where I test the limits of what I can learn—like Morse code in an hour or mastering drawing in 20 hours. I believe growth should be fun, measurable, and inspiring. That’s why I’m building a gamified life system—from Bronze 5 to “One Above All”—to stay disciplined, track habits, and overcome distractions.</p>

<p>I’m fluent in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, and English, and I bring strong communication, teamwork, and design thinking to the table. I’m also deeply focused on self-control and eliminating habits that slow me down. Every day is a chance to evolve, and I’m all in for it.</p>

<p>If you’re into creativity, tech, self-mastery, and leveling up—welcome to my world. Let’s build something extraordinary.
